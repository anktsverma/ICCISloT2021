        <p class="pR2">The proposed <span class="sR2">3rd International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Security & IoT (ICCISIoT), 2020</span>  will be held at National Institute of Technology, Agartala, India to enable researchers build connections between different digital technologies based on Computational Intelligence, Security and Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
        <p class="pR2">Through sharing and networking, ICCISIoT 2020 will provide an opportunity for researchers, practitioners and educators to exchange research evidence, practical experiences and innovative ideas on issues related to the Conference theme.</p>
        <p class="pR2">Please consider submitting your works to this conference. We are interested in the entire range of concepts from theory to practice, including case studies, works-in-progress, and conceptual explorations.</p>

            <h2 class="hR2">About the conference</h2>
            <p class="pR2">Information and Communication are playing an increasing role in society and within our lives. Recognizing this, ICCISIoT 2020 aims to provide a forum for researchers from both academia and industry to share their latest research contributions, future vision in the field and potential impact across industries.        </p>
            <p>Join us, 29-30 December 2020, to explore discovery, progress, and achievements related to various Computational Intelligence Techniques and Internet of Things. Click here for conference topics. </p>
            <p>Computational Intelligence is a set of nature-inspired computational methodologies and approaches to address complex real-world problems to which mathematical or traditional modelling can be useless for a few reasons: the processes might be too complex for mathematical reasoning, it might contain some uncertainties during the process, or the process might simply be stochastic in nature. Indeed, many real-life problems cannot be translated into a binary language (unique values of 0 and 1) for computers to process it. Computational Intelligence therefore provides solutions for such problems.</p> 
            <p>The recent adoption of a variety of enabling Wireless communication technologies such as RFID tags, BLE, ZigBee, etc. and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, and various protocols such as CoAP, MQTT, DNS etc. have made IoT step out of its infancy. Now smart sensors can collaborate directly with machine without human involvement to automate decision making or to control a task. Smart technologies including green electronics, green radios, fuzzy neural approaches and intelligent signal processing techniques play important roles in the developments of the wearable healthcare systems. This conference aims at providing a forum to discuss the recent advances on enabling technologies and applications for IoT.</p>
            <p>The ICCISIoT 2020 conference is a platform to discuss advances in Computational Intelligence,Security and Internet of Things (IoT). The conference will provide its attendees an uncommon opportunity to expand their network beyond their immediate professional environment. It is a unique chance to work with other accomplished individuals from diverse areas towards the common goal of shaping the future of the communication, computing and society.</p>
